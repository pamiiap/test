<div class="basicrulestext"><p>In City of Mist, each player is a <b>Rift</b>. An ordinary person who is a gateway to an mythical force called a <b>Mythos</b>. The Mythoi are a strange, unknown, source of magical power that is hidden from the ordinary people of the city called <b>Sleepers</b>. Yet, even with their mystical powers, they still have a life. Each Rift has an <b>Identity</b>, their <b>Logos</b>, a piece of their life that keeps them grounded, a part of them that keeps them human. On the other hand they have their <b>Mystery</b>, their Mythos, the part of them that they want to unravel and solve. <p>These rules are expanded upon in the free City of Mist Basic Rules PDF that is linked <a href="#download">here</a>.</p></div>

<div class="playerrules"><h3>Player Moves</h3></div>
<div class="playerrulestext"><p>Unlike other TTRPGs (Table-top Roleplaying Games), players roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) to determine if their character passes or fails a move. You roll these dice and add your power tags (more on those in the Character Creation sections) to determine how powerful your move is.<br> <br>

    To make a move in City of Mist, the player has to choose between eight core moves: Change the Game, Convince, Go Toe to Toe, Hit with All You’ve Got, Investigate, Sneak Around and Take the Risk. Each move has a different purpose depending on what you would like to do. For example: If you would like to throw a punch at an enemy, you would use the move Hit With All You’ve Got. More information on all of these core moves below:
<br><br>
    <i>Convince</i><br>
When you use your abilities to talk, threaten, or seduce someone into doing something, roll+Power. On a hit, choose a relevant status with tier=Power. Your target can choose either to take the status or: 
    <ul><li>on a 7-9, to give in a little, but protect their own agenda. </li><li>on a 10+, to change their agenda to include yours, at least for the time being.</li></ul>
        <p><i>Go Toe to Toe</i><br>
    When you use your abilities to overcome someone or something in a struggle for control, state what your goal is. Your opponent can describe how they respond, at their option. Roll+Power. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2: </p>
    <ul><li>You manage to achieve your goal, e.g., take something they hold. </li><li>You get them good, giving your opponent a status with tier=Power. </li><li>You block, dodge, or counter their best attempts. If you don’t choose this, they can impose a status on you. If they are a PC, its tier=their Power.
    </li></ul>
    <p><i>Investigate</i><br>
        When you use your abilities to seek answers to burning questions, roll+Power. On a hit, you get Clues=Power. Spend your Clues one-to-one to ask the MC a question about the subject of your investigation or ask another player a relevant question about their character. They must give you either a straight answer or a solid lead. On a 7-9, they can also choose 1: 
        <ul><li>Your investigation exposes you to danger. </li><li>The clues you get are fuzzy, incomplete, or part-true part-false. </li><li>Whoever or whatever you are asking the question(s) can ask you one question as well. You answer on the same terms.</li></ul></p>
<p><i>Change the Game</i><br>
    When you use your abilities to give yourself or your allies an advantage, roll+Power. On a hit, you get Juice=Power. Spend your Juice to gain the following effects, one-to-one:
    <ul><li>Create a story tag</li><li>Burn a power tag or a story tag</li><li>Give or reduce a status (one tier per point of Juice)</li></ul></p>
<p>On a 10+, you get a minimum of 2 Juice, and you can also use your Juice to choose:
    <ul><li>Scale up the effect (greater area or more targets)</li><li>Prolong the effect (make it ongoing)</li><li>Hide the effect </li><li>Any other improvement you and the MC agree on</li></ul>
<p><i>Face Danger</i><br>
    When you use your abilities to avoid an incoming hit, endure harm, resist a malign influence, or hold it together, the MC (or player) will name a status with its tag and tier. Roll+Power. On a 10+, you fend off the effect and take no status at all. On a 7-9, you take the status, but with -1 tier. On a miss, you take the full status.
    <p>Hit With All You've Got
        When you have a clear shot and you use your abilities to hit someone or something with all you’ve got, roll+Power. On a hit, you give the target an appropriate status of your choice with tier=Power. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1: 
        <ul><li>You take cover or secure a superior position. If you don’t choose this, they can impose a status on you. If they are a PC, its tier=their Power. </li><li>You get them good or get many of them (+1 tier). </li><li>You control the collateral damage.</li><li>You hold the target’s attention, if possible. </li><li>You gain the upper hand. Take 1 Juice.</li></ul>
    <p><i>Sneak Around</i><br>
        When you use your abilities to act secretly or deceptively, roll+Power. On a hit, everyone that should fall for it falls for it. On a 7-9, it’s complicated. The MC chooses 1:
    <ul><li>Someone unimportant noticed you, but that just made them important, right? </li><li>You are perceived only by a secondary sense (someone picks up your scent while you’re stalking them; you’re seen whispering a message but the message is not heard). </li><li>You must leave something important behind – or be discovered.</li></ul>    
    <p><i>Take the Risk</i><br>
        When you perform a daring, risky, or outright stupid feat, roll+Power. On a 10+, you do it, somehow. On a 7-9, things get messy. The MC will offer you a hard bargain or an ugly choice.
